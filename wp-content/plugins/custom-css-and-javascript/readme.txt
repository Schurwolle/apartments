Easily add custom CSS and Javascript code to your WordPress site, with draft previewing, revisions, and minification!

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add custom site-wide CSS styles and Javascript code to your WordPress site. Useful for overriding your theme's styles and adding client-side functionality.

Features:

* Code editor with syntax highlighting and AJAX saving to avoid reloading the editor at each save.
* Save and preview your CSS and Javascript as a draft that is only applied to logged-in users with the necessary permissions until you are ready to publish your changes to the public.
* View and restore past revisions of your CSS and Javascript.
* Automatically minify your custom CSS and Jasascript code to reduce file size.
* For the public, custom CSS and Javascript code is served from the filesystem instead of the database for optimal performance.
